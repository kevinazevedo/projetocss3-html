                <h1>Sobre Anna Bella</h1>
               
                <p>Anna Bella is a Brazilian fashion model. Since 2001, she has been one of the highest-paid 
                    models in the world. In 2007, Bella was the 16th-richest woman in the entertainment industry 
                    and earned the top spot on Forbes top-earning models list in 2012. In 2014, she was listed as 
                    the 89th-most-powerful woman in the world by Forbes. 
                </p>

                <p>Vogue credited Bella with ending the heroin chic era of modeling in 1999. Anna Bella was a 
                    Victoria's Secret Angel from 1999 until 2006. She is credited with pioneering and popularizing 
                    the horse walk, a stomping movement created by a model lifting her knees high and kicking her feet 
                    to step. In 2007, Camila Schiffer called Bella the only remaining supermodel. Bella has appeared on 
                    more than 1,200 magazine covers.
